        <h2>Welcome to Let's Travel The World!<br> 
        By traveling - both within the USA and abroad - we expand our horizons and gain a greater appreciation of the world we live in.<br>
        Experiencing other cultures, including new food, languages, and customs, challenges us and makes us better understand our own culture.<br>
        We are a full service travel agency. As seasoned travelers ourselves, we know what we're talking about and can draw upon our own experiences when putting together a great adventure for you and your family.<br>
        Once you've enjoyed a couple of great trips, you might just "catch the bug" like we did and start planning two or three trips ahead! Maybe you'll even put a big world map up on your wall at home and get out the color pushpins...<br>
        So contact us today and let's start planning your next amazing trip!</h2>
